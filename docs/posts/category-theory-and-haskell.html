<p>
What is abstraction? Abstraction is a learned skill where we make a conscious
decision to magnifiy the similarities between "things" and ignore their
differences.
</p>

<p>
As software developers, why do we value abstraction? When we take an abstract
view of our our code we deal with <i>essence</i> rather than implementation. We think
primarily in terms <i>shape</i>, or <i>form</i>, and <i>behaviour</i> rather than the sequence
of instructions required to create a complete program.
</p>

<p>
This abstract way of thinking magnifies the similarities between "things" in our
codebase and helps us to identify common patterns in our code, whether that
commonality is in form or in behaviour. This means that we can generalize and
write code that is powerful in the sense that it can be used and re-used on many
different "things", provided that they exhibit certain behaviour or have
a certain form. This is the promise of interfaces in languages like C++ and Java
(there are a few reasons why interfaces don't always live up to that promise
[3], but I'll avoid that topic for now). Abstraction also helps us to reason
about code (ours and other's) because it allows us to view the behaviour of the
code at higher, cognitively-easier-to-process level.
</p>

<p>
We call the abstract things we create 'abstractions'. Wouldn't it be nice if we
had a field of mathematics (and the years of research that entails) that could
aid us in identifying abstractions? That could provide a solid foundation for us
to build our programs on?
</p>

<p>
It turns out that we do: Category Theory. Category Theory is the study, &#x2026;
Category Theory, practically, is the &#x2026; The nice thing about using an
established field of mathematics is that the abstractions identified by Category
Theory are usually very general and stable, which encourages the creation of
re-usable code, which is exactly what we want.
</p>

<p>
Bartosz Milewski has a great series on <i>Category Theory for Programmers</i> [1],
but I won't be so thorough, hopefully this series of articles will give you a
practical but light understanding of Type Classes in Haskell and how they're
useful to us (and their relationship with Category Theory).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5ae81b1">
<p>
(Skip to the next article if you already understand the concept of Type
classes).
</p>

<p>
Type classes can be thought of as Haskell's version of the interfaces in other
languages. This is far from strictly true, but is a good enough comparison to
serve as our intuition: a set of functions with no implementation (or a default
implementation) that data types must implement to be considered an instance of
the type class.
</p>

<p>
Type classes allow us to express common, repeated patterns in our code and to in
future, treat many different types objects as instances of that type class
(provided they conform to the interface the type class defines).

<div id="outline-container-orgf92691c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf92691c">Monoid</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf92691c">
<p>
One example of a type class is the Monoid type class (*):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell"><span style="color: #bf568b;">class</span> <span style="color: #8bbf56;">Monoid</span> a <span style="color: #bf568b;">where</span>
  mempty  <span style="color: #bf8b56;">::</span> a
  mappend <span style="color: #bf8b56;">::</span> a <span style="color: #bf8b56;">-&gt;</span> a <span style="color: #bf8b56;">-&gt;</span> a
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1b9253f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1b9253f">What is a Monoid?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1b9253f">
<p>
Monoid is used to categorize data types that have a binary operation, and a
value that acts a neutral element in this operation. Pretty abstract isn't it?
When approaching category theory, get used to thinking at this kind of abstract
level. When writing C++, I tended to think too concretely to be able to identify
these kind of patterns.
</p>

<p>
An example: integers form a monoid under multiplication. Multiplication is the
binary operation:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-txt">3 * 3 = 9
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and the integer '1' is the neutral element, as any integer <code>x</code> multiplied by 1
gives us back <code>x</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-txt">3 * 1 = 3
-4 * 1 = -4
x * 1 = x
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can express this in Haskell by declaring Integer to be an instance of Monoid:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell"><span style="color: #bf568b;">instance</span> <span style="color: #8bbf56;">Monoid</span> <span style="color: #8bbf56;">Integer</span> <span style="color: #bf568b;">where</span>
  mempty  <span style="color: #bf8b56;">::</span> <span style="color: #8bbf56;">Integer</span>
  mempty <span style="color: #bf8b56;">=</span> <span style="color: #bfbf56;">1</span>

  mappend <span style="color: #bf8b56;">::</span> <span style="color: #8bbf56;">Integer</span> <span style="color: #bf8b56;">-&gt;</span> <span style="color: #8bbf56;">Integer</span> <span style="color: #bf8b56;">-&gt;</span> <span style="color: #8bbf56;">Integer</span>
  mappend <span style="color: #bf8b56;">=</span> <span style="color: #bf568b;">(</span><span style="color: #bf8b56;">*</span><span style="color: #bf568b;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that integers also form a monoid under addition. Because there can only be
one instance of a type class for a given type, Haskell wraps Integers into 'Sum'
and 'Product' types, the first forming a Monoid under addition and the second
under multiplication. Don't worry about this too much.
</p>

<p>
Many other things form a Monoid. For example, lists form a Monoid under
concatenation (++), with an empty list ([]) acting as the neutral element
(Strings also form a Monoid under concatenation, since strings are just lists of
characters in Haskell).
</p>


<p>
Words like <b>Monoid</b>, <b>Functor</b>, <b>Applicative</b> and <b>Monad</b> sound scary, but
they're only 'mathy' words used to describe collections of common properties
that things have and laws they obey. 
</p>

<p>
'things' that have specific
properties and obey certain laws. With this series of posts I hope to get you
past the initial hurdles to understanding these powerful patterns and show you
how category theory can help you write more generic code.
