<h3 id="orga8b38eb">Abstraction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga8b38eb">
<p>
Software developers do alot of abstraction. When we "abstract", we make a
conscious decision to magnifiy the similarities between "things" and ignore
their differences. In doing so we create "abstractions": interfaces that take
advantage of common patterns of <i>form</i> and <i>behaviour</i> in our code, allowing us
to think about our programs at a higher level. A car provides us a with a simple
interface (pedals, steering wheel) to operate a very complex machine. As
drivers, we (usually) don't have to worry about the internals of our car, we
merely operate the interface. This is an example of abstraction.
</p>

<p>
As programmers we build abstractions for files, memory, HTTP requests, web
forms, etc. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a field of mathematics (and the years
of research that entails) to aid us in identifying abstractions? That could
provide a solid foundation for us to build our programs on?
</p>

<p>
It turns out that we do: Category Theory. For a good definition of Category
Theory see <a href="#org58a460b">1</a> and <a href="#org58a460b">2</a>, but essentially Category Theory is a field concerned
with structure, composition and identity. Category Theory provides a formal
basis for abstractions like Monoid, Functor, Applicative and Monad. 
</p>

<p>
I find Category Theory exciting because it provides a more principled source of
abstractions and ideas for programmers to build their programs upon. The nice
thing about using an established field of mathematics is that the abstractions
identified by Category Theory are usually very general and stable, which
encourages the creation of general and re-usable code: a much desired property.
</p>

<p>
Bartosz Milewski has a great series called <i>Category Theory for Programmers</i>
<a href="#org58a460b">1</a> <a href="#org58a460b">2</a>, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to be so thorough, hopefully this
series of articles will instead give you a practical but light understanding of
Type Classes in Haskell, how they're useful to us, and their relationship with
Category Theory.

<div id="outline-container-org7212d6c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7212d6c">Type classes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7212d6c">
<p>
Type classes can be thought of as Haskell's version of the interfaces in other
languages. This is not strictly true, but is good enough to serve as our
intuition: a set of functions with no implementation (or a default
implementation) that data types must implement to be considered an instance.
</p>

<p>
Type classes allow us to express common, repeated patterns in our code and to,
in future, treat many different data types according to a common interface.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org18dfb1b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org18dfb1b">Monoid</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org18dfb1b">
<p>
One example of a type class from Category Theory is the Monoid type class (*):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell"><span style="color: #3a81c3; font-weight: bold;">class</span> <span style="color: #ba2f59; font-weight: bold;">Monoid</span> a <span style="color: #3a81c3; font-weight: bold;">where</span>
  mempty  <span style="color: #715ab1;">::</span> a
  mappend <span style="color: #715ab1;">::</span> a <span style="color: #715ab1;">-&gt;</span> a <span style="color: #715ab1;">-&gt;</span> a
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Monoid is used to categorize data types that have a binary operation, and a
value that acts a neutral element in that operation. Pretty abstract isn't it?
When approaching category theory, get used to thinking at this kind of abstract
level. When writing C++, I tended to think too concretely to be able to identify
these kind of patterns.
</p>

<p>
An example: integers form a monoid under multiplication. Multiplication is the
binary operation:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-txt">3 * 3 = 9
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and the integer '1' is the neutral element, as any integer <code>x</code> multiplied by 1
gives us back <code>x</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-txt"> 3 * 1 =  3
-4 * 1 = -4
 x * 1 =  x
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can express this in Haskell by declaring Integer to be an instance of Monoid:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell"><span style="color: #3a81c3; font-weight: bold;">instance</span> <span style="color: #ba2f59; font-weight: bold;">Monoid</span> <span style="color: #ba2f59; font-weight: bold;">Integer</span> <span style="color: #3a81c3; font-weight: bold;">where</span>
  mempty  <span style="color: #715ab1;">::</span> <span style="color: #ba2f59; font-weight: bold;">Integer</span>
  mempty <span style="color: #715ab1;">=</span> <span style="color: #4e3163;">1</span>

  mappend <span style="color: #715ab1;">::</span> <span style="color: #ba2f59; font-weight: bold;">Integer</span> <span style="color: #715ab1;">-&gt;</span> <span style="color: #ba2f59; font-weight: bold;">Integer</span> <span style="color: #715ab1;">-&gt;</span> <span style="color: #ba2f59; font-weight: bold;">Integer</span>
  mappend <span style="color: #715ab1;">=</span> <span style="color: #3a81c3;">(</span><span style="color: #715ab1;">*</span><span style="color: #3a81c3;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that integers also form a monoid under addition. Because there can only be
one instance of a type class for a given type, Haskell wraps Integers into 'Sum'
and 'Product' types, the first forming a Monoid under addition and the second
under multiplication. Don't worry about this too much.
</p>

<p>
Many other things form a Monoid. For example, lists form a Monoid under
concatenation (++). The empty list ([]) acts as the neutral element in this
operation.
</p>

<p>
Now that we've defined a Monoid instance for our Integers, we can use them
wherever we can use a Monoid. There is a wealth of standard library functions
that deal with Monoids and this is part of the power of type classes.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to try and identify these structures within your codebase. If a
particular function is only making use of the equivalent of <code>mempty</code> and
<code>mappend</code>, it can be generalized to act on Monoids.
