/A simple POSIX shell implemented in C/

[[file:../img/sane.png]]

** Things learnt:

- Designing larger programs in C.
- POSIX API.
- Automated testing using the [[http://expect.sourceforge.net][expect]] command-line tool, importance of good testing.
- Tracking issues using GitHub's web tools.

The shell is functional and fairly robust, but what I was most proud of was the
way I approached testing the shell. I created an [[http://expect.sourceforge.net][expect]] script which
allowed me to automate the running of a number of use cases. I used this script
to run full regression tests whenever I made changes. This allowed me to be
confident about the stability of the codebase at all times.
